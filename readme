All the Movie Requests were filtered in the below order:

first the request with movie seats requested is more than than the theater count then couldn't 
handle message is displayed.

Later requests with seats requested greater than the max section were kept in hold in temphold.

Then these filtered requests are sorted ascendingly and  were assigned seats if one or
more than one movie requests together have number of requested seats which matches exactly with 
any of the theater section layout number starting from the front. 

After all this process then remaining requests and other hold requests are assigned seats if there are
remaining seats after the above allocation.

Finally if they are any movie requests with seats requested less than remaining seats then they are called to split
else if seats requested are more then they are denied.Everthing is printed in accordance with initial
list from the input.
